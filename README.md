# Weather-app

Welcome to my weather app project! This web application is built using React and the OpenWeather API to provide users with current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city in the world. You can also use your current location to get weather updates for your area.

## Features:

- Search for a city and get suggestions for matching locations.
- Use your current location to automatically fetch weather data.
- View current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- See a 5-day forecast with temperature and weather condition information for each day.
- Get weather information for any city in the world.

Please note that this app is not yet responsive, so it may not display properly on all devices. However, I am working on adding responsive design in future updates.
